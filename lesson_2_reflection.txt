What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

This initialises an empty Git repository in the current directory. You need to
do this so that the metadata of the various versions of your code can be saved
as a history in the hidden .git directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area serves as an intermediate area. It gives us more control to
keep commits small with one commit per logical change by allowing us to specify
exactly what changes are to be committed. We can add files one at a time to the
staging area from the working directory. When we are ready to commit, git
bundles the entire contents of the staging area into a single commit to add to
the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
