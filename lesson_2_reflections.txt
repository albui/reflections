What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

This initialises an empty Git repository in the current directory. You need to
do this so that the metadata of the various versions of your code can be saved
as a history in the hidden .git directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area serves as an intermediate area. It gives us more control to
keep commits small with one commit per logical change by allowing us to specify
exactly what changes are to be committed. We can add files one at a time to the
staging area from the working directory. When we are ready to commit, git
bundles the entire contents of the staging area into a single commit to add to
the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

If there are multiple changes in the working directory, you can add a single
file at a time to the staging area if the logical change only involves one
file. After it is added, git status can be used to double check the addition
encompasses only a single logical change before committing.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

Branches allow you to have multiple versions of your program, e.g. different
language, experimental feature implemented, master branch. This means that
while you are working on a branch that may introduce bugs, you still have a
bug-free working version that you can demonstrate to others.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
