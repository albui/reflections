When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

A remote repository is useful when you are collaborating with others so that
the work being done is kept at a central location that is accessible to
everyone rather than on a single computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

There may be many commits being made to the remote repository by many
collaborators and so having automatic pulls from the remote would mean many
inconvenient connections to GitHub. By manually pulling changes, you can
control how often the repository is updated by pulling multiple commits at once
